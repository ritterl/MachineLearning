This section of the book serves to show how machine learning algorithms can be evaluated. More precisely, it gives reasons why also other measures than predictive accuracy are needed to assess performance. Further, approaches to ensure that the performance measures reasonably reflect a model's ability to predict or forecast unseen cases are provided. "

This especially arises in datasets with a large class imbalance and is also referred to as **class imbalance problem**. For instance, a positive event occurs very often (in say 99% of the cases), a model which predicts always a positive case has an accuracy of 99%. However, it is not useful for predicting the negative cases. "

Therefore, it is important to note that the code of chapter 4 needs to be executed prior to this section. In this example, the `predict() `function gives the probability for each possible outcome. Each line of the following output sums up to 1 due to the fact that these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.

These two are important to find a balanced model which is neither too conservative nor too aggressive. When taking the SMS example: On the one hand, this means that the model should not classify almost every single SMS (specificity) as spam and on the other hand, it should not allow too many spam SMS getting through the filter (sensitivity). It is apparent that these two goals can be considered a tradeoff. Therefore, it is important to decide, which measure is more relevant. With the SMS example, it can be said that it is worse if a ham SMS is deleted because it is considered as spam than if a spam SMS is not deleted and it ends up in the inbox. "
