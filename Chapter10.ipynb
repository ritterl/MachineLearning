        "In this notebook, chapter 10 of [Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.de/Machine-Learning-techniques-predictive-modeling-ebook/dp/B07PYXX3H5) with R is summarized and the code samples are described. This section of the book serves to show how machine learning algorithms can be evaluated. More precisely, it gives reasons why also other measures than predictive accuracy are needed to assess performance. Further, approaches to ensure that the performance measures reasonably reflect a model's ability to predict or forecast unseen cases are provided. "

        "By simply dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions, a wrong picture about the performance of the classifier may occur. This especially arises in datasets with a large class imbalance and is also referred to as **class imbalance problem**. For instance, a positive event occurs very often (in say 99% of the cases), a model which predicts always a positive case has an accuracy of 99%. However, it is not useful for predicting the negative cases. "

So, when comparing two models with the same number of mistakes, it is possible to say that the one which makes better assessments regarding its uncertainty is smarter."

        "First of all, the predicted probabilities from the SMS model developed in chapter 4 of the book are drawn. Therefore, it is important to note that the code of chapter 4 needs to be executed prior to this section. In this example, the predict () function gives the probability for each possible outcome. Each line of the following output sums up to 1 due to the fact that these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. In other words: An SMS can only either be \"ham\" or \"spam\", but not both at the same time and it cannot be something else or something in between. "
