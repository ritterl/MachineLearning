This section of the book serves to show how machine learning algorithms can be evaluated. More precisely, it gives reasons why also other measures than predictive accuracy are needed to assess performance. Further, approaches to ensure that the performance measures reasonably reflect a model's ability to predict or forecast unseen cases are provided. "

This especially arises in datasets with a large class imbalance and is also referred to as **class imbalance problem**. For instance, a positive event occurs very often (in say 99% of the cases), a model which predicts always a positive case has an accuracy of 99%. However, it is not useful for predicting the negative cases. "

Therefore, it is important to note that the code of chapter 4 needs to be executed prior to this section. In this example, the `predict() `function gives the probability for each possible outcome. Each line of the following output sums up to 1 due to the fact that these are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events.

        "In the next section, two very important measures will be introduced, sensitivity and specificity. These two are important to find a balanced model which is neither too conservative nor too aggressive. When taking the SMS example: On the one hand, this means that the model should not classify almost every single SMS (specificity) as spam and on the other hand, it should not allow too many spam SMS getting through the filter (sensitivity). It is apparent that these two goals can be considered a tradeoff. Therefore, it is important to decide, which measure is more relevant. With the SMS example, it can be said that it is worse if a ham SMS is deleted because it is considered as spam than if a spam SMS is not deleted and it ends up in the inbox. "

Therefore, a precise model predicts the positive class only, if it is very confident about its decision. When applying the SMS filter, a high precision would mean that the model is only filtering and deleting messages that are actually spam. The formula is the following: precision = TP / (TP + FP)"

        "So far, only \"numbers\" have been introduced, but it is also possible to visualize performance by aid of **ROC curves** (receiver operating characteristic curve) for instance. Different models have different strenghts and weaknesses and even if they have the same accuracy it is possible that their decisions and their confidence varies greatly. Typically, the y-axis of the ROC curve represents the TP-rate (sensitivity) and the x-axis represents the FP-rate (= 1 - specificity). Hence, by using ROC curves it is possible to get a deeper understanding of tradeoffs between models with distinct characteristics. To create a ROC curve, the `pRoc` package is needed. "

        "In this plot a ROC curve for the SMS example is shown. The diagonal grey line represents a model that only predicts by \"chance\" and therefore, has no predictive value, since it predicts TP's and FP's at the same rate. On the contrary, a model with perfect predictive value would go through the 100% TP-rate. The blue line depicts the SMS spam filter model which obviously has a very high predictive value. Simply put, the larger the area between the blue line and the grey line, the better the classifier. It is possible to calculate the area under the ROC curve **(AUC)**, whereas 0.5 represents a model with no predictive power and 1 a model with perfect predictive power. As the AUC can be the same for differently shaped curves, it is important not to use solely the AUC, but also other measures.  "
